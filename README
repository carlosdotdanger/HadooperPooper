Reimplementing some of the hadoop-ec2 tools without so much shell script as a way to get cozy with the AWS SDK.

Building - 
it's currently setup as a Netbeans project, will be getting the Netbeans stuff out soon.

depends on:
--aws-sdk 
http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/

--commons-codec v. 1.4 (aws includes 1.3 but I had issues using it)
http://commons.apache.org/codec/

--log4j
http://logging.apache.org/log4j/

--ganymed (ssh lib)
http://www.cleondris.ch/opensource/ssh2/

setup the required libraries and build.

Configuring --
there's sample config files in dist/config
to launch a cluster you need to choose or build an AMI, preferably with hadoop installed, but you could install hadoop on startup without too much effort.

Running -- 

run pooper.sh in dist/bin after building.

As of this writing, HaddooperPooper can launch,terminate,list,scp single files and describe clusters like the hadoop-ec2 tools, will be adding multi-file (wildcard) and directory scp copies, logins and port forwarding.
