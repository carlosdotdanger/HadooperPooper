Reimplementing some of the hadoop-ec2 tools without so much shell script as a way to get cozy with the AWS SDK.

Building - 
it's currently setup as a netbeans project depends on:
--aws-sdk
--commons-codec v. 1.4 (aws includes 1.3 but I had issues using it)
--log4j

setup the required libs, build.

Configuring --
there's sample config files in dist/config

Running -- 

run pooper.sh in dist/bin

as-is HaddooperPooper can launch,terminate,list and describe clusters like the hadoop-ec2 tools, once I choose an ssh library will be adding file pushes, logins and port forwarding.
